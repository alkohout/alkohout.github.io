          <h2>Waves In Ice Observing System (WIIOS) Development</h2>
	  <p>
	  During research into wave-ice interactions, I discovered a significant disconnect: while theoretical models were becoming increasingly sophisticated, we lacked the observational data needed to validate them. 
	  This gap, combined with predictions of intensifying wave activity in the Southern Ocean, motivated me to transition from theoretical modeling to hands-on data collection.
          </p>
	  <h3>Developing Innovative Technology</h3>
	  <p>
	  The harsh polar environment presented unique challenges to obtaining observational data: massive waves, crushing ice, hurricane-force winds, and sub-zero temperatures demanded exceptional equipment durability. 
	  In collaboration with P.A.S. software and electrical engineers, we developed custom wave-in-ice sensors. 
	  This project benefited from the expertise of Martin Doble, whose insights were crucial for hull design and wave data analysis. 
	  While P.A.S. focused on hardware, software, and GUI development, I specialized in implementing <a href="https://alkohout.github.io/projects/waves-in-ice/WIIOS/wave_analysis/" target="_blank" >onboard wave analysis</a> algorithms to ensure precise data collection <a href="https://github.com/alkohout/waves-in-ice.git" target="_blank" >(GitHub)</a> <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/annals-of-glaciology/article/device-for-measuring-waveinduced-motion-of-ice-floes-in-the-antarctic-marginal-ice-zone/BBFF5522226DC1383DAF210F7C8B9F61" target="_blank"> (Kohout <it> et. al. </it>, 2015).</a>
          <h3>Real-Time Spectral Analysis for Wave Motion Processing in Ice</h3>
          <p>As part of the Waves in Ice Observation System (WIIOS) project, I developed a C-based signal processing system to analyze wave motion data in sea ice environments. This project was a unique challenge, as my formal programming training was limited to Fortran basics during my mathematics degree. I independently learned C to build this system from the ground up. Due to the constrained memory on the sensors, only essential libraries were included, requiring me to write all algorithms from scratch. As a result, the code deviates from conventional formatting standards. Please note that this software was initially developed for personal use and not intended for public sharing. I am currently working on refining the code with AI assistance to make it accessible in a polished, shareable format. Below, I outline the core components of the system, accompanied by relevant code snippets.</p>

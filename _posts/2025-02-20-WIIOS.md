          <h1>Waves In Ice Observing System (WIIOS) Development</h1>
	  <p> During my PhD modelling wave and ice interaction, I realised the theoretical development in this research field was well ahead of the observations and these sophisticated models could not be adequately tested. Additionally, wave modellers were forecasting a future with bigger waves in the Southern Ocean. This inspired me to take off my modellers hat and dive into the realm of data collection.</p>
<p> To achieve this we needed unique equipment which could survive the harsh conditions of polar oceans; large waves, crushing ice, hurricane force winds and freezing temperatures. Teaming up with P.A.S software and electrical engineers, we developed wave-in-ice sensors from the ground up, addressing the lack of available off-the-shelf solutions. Our observing system emerged from extensive discussions with Martin Doble, whose expertise was invaluable in supporting hull design and wave data analysis. P.A.S. crafted the hardware, software, and developed a live GUI, while I engineered the onboard wave analysis, ensuring precise and reliable data collection. For more details on the software and electrical engineering, see P.A.S. For the raw wave data processing onboard the sensors, see my <a href="https://github.com/alkohout/waves-in-ice.git" target="_blank" >GitHub</a> page.</p>
	  <p> Throughout this project, we were granted funding support through various channels including the National Institue of Water and Atmosphere (NIWA) core funding under the National Climate Center, University of Tasmania, Australian Antarctic Division, Antarctica New Zealand, U.S. Office of Naval Research, the Australian Climate and Ecosystems Cooperative Research Center, the Australian Research Council  and New Zealand research grants including the Marsden Fund Council through the Royal Society of New Zealand, Foundation of Research Science and Technology and Deep South National Science Challenge.

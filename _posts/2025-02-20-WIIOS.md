          <h3>Waves In Ice Observing System (WIIOS) Development</h3>
	  <h5>From Theory to Practice: Bridging the Gap in Wave-Ice Research</h5>
	  <p>
	  During research into wave-ice interactions, I discovered a significant disconnect: while theoretical models were becoming increasingly sophisticated, we lacked the observational data needed to validate them. 
	  This gap, combined with predictions of intensifying wave activity in the Southern Ocean, motivated me to transition from theoretical modeling to hands-on data collection.
          </p>
	  <h5>Developing Innovative Technology</h5>
	  <p>
	  The harsh polar environment presented unique challenges: massive waves, crushing ice, hurricane-force winds, and sub-zero temperatures demanded exceptional equipment durability. 
	  In collaboration with P.A.S. software and electrical engineers, we developed custom wave-in-ice sensors. 
	  This project benefited from the expertise of Martin Doble, whose insights were crucial for hull design and wave data analysis. 
	  While P.A.S. focused on hardware, software, and GUI development, I specialized in implementing onboard wave analysis algorithms to ensure precise data collection <a href="https://github.com/alkohout/waves-in-ice.git" target="_blank" >(GitHub)</a>.
	  </p>
	  <h5> Implementation of Real-Time Spectral Analysis for Wave Motion Processing </h5>
	  <h6> Technical Implementation Overview:</h6>
	  <p>
	  I developed a C-based signal processing system for analyzing wave motion data with the following key components:
	  </p>
	  <h6> Data Acquisition & Preprocessing: </h6>
	  <p>
	  Implemented 640-second burst sampling at 64Hz from IMU and Kistler accelerometer
	  Designed digital filtering system using:
	  Low-pass 2nd order Butterworth filter (0.5Hz cutoff)
	  Downsampling to 2Hz
	  High-pass filtering for displacement calculations
	  Spectral Analysis Core:
	  Implemented Welch's method for power spectral density estimation:
	  256-second segments with 50% overlap
	  10% cosine windowing
	  Detrending algorithms for each segment
	  Developed spectral moment calculations for:
	  Wave height (Hs) derivation from zeroth moment
	  Peak period (Tp) computation from power spectrum
	  Quality Control System:
	  Designed automated data validation:
	  20% threshold checking for sensor responsiveness
	  Statistical validation tests
	  Spike detection algorithms
	  Consecutive data change monitoring
	  Real-time Processing:
	  Optimized for embedded system constraints:
	  Dual-core Edison processor
	  1GB RAM limitation
	  32GB SD storage management
	  </p>

	  <h6>Technical Skills Demonstrated:</h6>
	  <p>
	  Digital Signal Processing
	  Real-time embedded systems programming
	  Statistical analysis
	  Data validation algorithms
	  Sensor integration
	  Memory optimization
	  </p>
